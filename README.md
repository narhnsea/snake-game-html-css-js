# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows you to control a snake on a grid and eat food to grow while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

## Getting Started

To play the game, open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## How to Play

- Press the `Space` key to start the game.
- Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`).
- Eat the red food cubes to make the snake grow.
- Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
- The game speed increases as the snake grows longer.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)

- The HTML structure contains a game board, instruction text, and logo elements.

### CSS (`style.css`)

- CSS styles define the appearance of the game board, snake, and food elements.
- It sets up a grid for the game board and defines the colors.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

- The JavaScript code handles game logic, including:
  - Initializing game variables such as gridSize, snake, food, and direction.
  - Drawing the game board, snake, and food.
  - Generating food at random positions.
  - Handling user input for controlling the snake's direction.
  - Moving the snake and checking for collisions.
  - Increasing the game speed as the snake grows.
  - Starting and ending the game.

## Customization

You can customize the game by adjusting variables and CSS styles to change the appearance, behavior, and difficulty of the game.
